# Binary-Classification-using-Keras-with-Tensorflow-backend
The program checks the onset of Diabetes - it is a binary classification problem (onset of diabetes as 1 or not as 0). All of the input variables that describe each patient are numerical. This makes it easy to use directly with neural networks that expect numerical input and output values, and ideal for our neural network in Keras.
